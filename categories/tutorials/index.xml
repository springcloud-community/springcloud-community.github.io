      <description>This article introduces the custom cache resolver in spring, by customizing the resolver, you can add additional processing in spring&amp;rsquo;s cache annotation.
 Specific code reference example project
 1. Overview The cache-aside pattern is a commonly used cache usage pattern. The usage flow is as follows.
When the data in the database is updated, the cache is invalidated so that the latest data in the database can be read subsequently, making the cached data consistent with the database data.</description>

      <description>Introducing scripting capabilities into our application can be a good way to improve flexibility. Our core development work can be focused on the development of core platform capabilities, and scenario-specific functionality can be implemented through scripting. For example, jenkins can write pipelines through groovy scripts, which can be very flexible to customize the build process. spring itself provides a mechanism for groovy integration, divided into two ways, one is to use groovy development program, similar to the development with java, need to be compiled.</description>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-04/spring-framework-rce-mitigation-alternative/</guid>
      <description>Yesterday we announced a Spring Framework RCE vulnerability CVE-2022-22965, listing Apache Tomcat as one of several preconditions. The Apache Tomcat team has since released versions 10.0.20 , 9.0.62 , and 8.5.78 all of which close the attack vector on Tomcat&amp;rsquo;s side. While the vulnerability is not in Tomcat itself, in real world situations, it is important to be able to choose among multiple upgrade paths that in turn provides flexibility and layered protection.</description>

      <description>Nacos, as a configuration center, necessarily needs to ensure high availability of service nodes, so how does Nacos implement clustering?
The following diagram, represents the deployment diagram of Nacos cluster.
How Nacos clusters work Nacos is an uncentralized node design in the cluster architecture as a configuration center. Since there are no master-slave nodes and no election mechanism, it is necessary to add virtual IPs (VIPs) in order to enable hot standby.</description>

      <description>1. Overview Feign abstracts the HTTP calls and makes them declarative. By doing so, Feign hides the lower-level details like HTTP connection management, hardcoded-URLs, and other boilerplate code. The significant advantage of using Feign clients is that HTTP calls are made easy and eliminate a lot of code. Typically, we use the Feign for REST APIs application/json media type. However, the Feign clients work well with other media types like text/xml , multipart requests, etc.</description>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-03/spring-resttemplate/</guid>
      <description>REST-styled APIs are all around us. Many applications need to invoke REST APIs for some or all of their functions. Hence for applications to function gracefully, they need to consume APIs elegantly and consistently.
RestTemplate is a class within the Spring framework that helps us to do just that. In this tutorial, we will understand how to use RestTemplate for invoking REST APIs of different shapes.
Example Code This article is accompanied by a working code example on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Add Prefix to All Spring Boot Controllers</title>
      <link>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-03/spring-boot-controllers-add-prefix/</link>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-03/spring-boot-controllers-add-prefix/</guid>
      <description>1. Introduction In Spring Boot applications, every controller can have its own URL mapping. This makes it easy for a single application to provide web endpoints at multiple locations. For example, we can group our API endpoints into logic groupings such as internal and external.
However, there may be times where we want all of our endpoints under a common prefix. In this tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at different ways to use a common prefix for all Spring Boot controllers.</description>

      <description>In a distributed, fast-paced environment, dev teams often want to find out at what time they deployed the app, what version of the app they deployed, what Git commit was deployed, and more.
Spring Boot Actuator helps us monitor and manage the application. It exposes various endpoints that provide app health, metrics, and other relevant information.
In this article, we will find out how to use Spring Boot Actuator and the Maven/Gradle build plugins to add such information to our projects.</description>

      <description>Most traditional applications deal with blocking calls or, in other words, synchronous calls. This means that if we want to access a particular resource in a system with most of the threads being busy, then the application would block the new one or wait until the previous threads complete processing its requests.
If we want to process Big Data , however, we need to do this with immense speed and agility.</description>

      <description>Monolithic solutions or solutions where a single point of failure can derail an operation is a big problem. In products and platforms that target availability as an essential feature, this problem ends up creating major engineering challenges. This difficulty can be solved with a Microservices architecture. This architecture aims to: Make processes independent and managed in a unique way and without interdependence, so responsibilities are divided and decentralized, something very common in a distributed computing pattern.</description>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-03/spring-boot-mongodb-logging/</guid>
      <description>1. Overview When using Spring Data MongoDB, we may need to log to a higher level than the default one. Typically, we may need to see, for example, some additional information such as statement executions or query parameters.
In this short tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how to modify the MongoDB logging level for queries.
2. Configure MongoDB Queries Logging MongoDB Support offers the MongoOperations interface or its primary MongoTemplate implementation to access data, so all we need is to configure a debug level for the MongoTemplate class.</description>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-03/resttemplate-multipart/</guid>
      <description>A multipart/form-data request can contain multiple sub-request bodies, each with its own separate header and body. Each sub-request body has its own separate header and body, and is typically used for file uploads. Here we use RestTemplate to send a multipart/form-data request.
RestTemplate It&amp;rsquo;s really simple, it&amp;rsquo;s all in the code.

      <description>Introduction Suppose our application organizes asynchronous domain logic inside DomainEventListener&amp;rsquo;s like the following code snippet.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  interface DomainEventListener { val topic: String fun handle(event: DomainEvent) } @Component class UserRegistered: DomainEventListener { override val topic = &amp;#34;user:registered&amp;#34; // How deserialization is performed is left out.  override fun handle(event: DomainEvent) { // perform business logic  } }   This post shows how to integrate these listeners with Spring AMQP by taking advantage of Spring&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure.</description>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-03/netflix-zuul-to-spring-cloud-gateway/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Netflix Zuul for many years as a proxy for APIs. Some weeks ago I tried to bootstrap a new project and add the zuul starter via spring initializr and couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it anymore. After some research it seems that Spring Cloud has moved over to Cloud Gateway and discontinued Netflix Zuul. Maybe this was just a rebranding of the Spring team but tbh I don&amp;rsquo;t care and want to follow the Spring Cloud team with that.</description>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-03/spring-security-without-the-websecurityconfigureradapter/</guid>
      <description>In Spring Security 5.7.0-M2 we deprecated the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter , as we encourage users to move towards a component-based security configuration.
To assist with the transition to this new style of configuration, we have compiled a list of common use-cases and the suggested alternatives going forward.
In the examples below we follow best practice by using the Spring Security lambda DSL and the method HttpSecurity#authorizeHttpRequests to define our authorization rules. If you are new to the lambda DSL you can read about it in this blog post.</description>
