      <description>On February 14, ðŸ’” the Keycloak team announced that they are deprecating most Keycloak adapters.
This includes adapters for Spring Security and Spring Boot, which means that in the future the Keycloak team will no longer provide integration solutions for Spring Security and Spring Boot.
The Keycloak project is a powerful OIDC (an extension of OAuth2) authorization server, and not even just an authorization server. It provides a number of adapters to provide an integration solution for other ecologies, but as mentioned in the official Keycloak statement.</description>

      <link>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2021-12/log4j2-vulnerability/</link>

      <description>The recently disclosed remote code execution vulnerability in Apache Log4j2, a Java-based logging component, has caused significant impact worldwide. This component is used extensively in business system development to record logging information about program input and output, and is extremely widely used. In most cases, developers write error messages caused by user input to the log.
The sudden disclosure of this vulnerability has not only caused developers using Log4j2 to &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; the problem overnight, but also caught the framework maintainers off guard.</description>

      <description>As you may have seen in the news, a new zero-day exploit has been reported against the popular Log4J2 library which can allow an attacker to remotely execute code. The vulnerability has been reported with CVE-2021-44228 against the log4j-core jar and has been fixed in Log4J v2.15.0.
Spring Boot users are only affected by this vulnerability if they have switched the default logging system to Log4J2. The log4j-to-slf4j and log4j-api jars that we include in spring-boot-starter-logging cannot be exploited on their own.</description>

      <description>On behalf of the team and everyone who has contributed, it is my pleasure to announce the release of Spring Native 0.11, which provides native support for Spring Boot 2.6. This ambitious release is the result of five months of hard work by the Spring team, who have been working on a brand new architecture to bring Spring support for creating native executables with GraalVM to the next level. You can already try it on start.</description>
