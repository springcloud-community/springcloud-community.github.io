      <description>The Spring Security team has officially announced that Spring Security OAuth has reached the end of its life with the termination of maintenance.
The home page of the official website has now been highlighted to alert the complete cessation of maintenance.
The old Spring Security OAuth project is terminated to 2.5.2.RELEASE version, and there will be no further iterations of the project, including Bug fixes. We have previously warned that the project will soon be discontinued for maintenance, and those who were paying attention have already migrated.</description>
