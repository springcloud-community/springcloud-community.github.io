      <description>XSS An XSS attack is usually a clever way of injecting malicious command code into a web page by exploiting a vulnerability left in the web page&amp;rsquo;s development, causing the user to load and execute a malicious web program created by the attacker. These malicious web programs are usually JavaScript, but can actually include Java, VBScript, ActiveX, Flash, or even plain HTML, and when the attack is successful, the attacker may gain access to a variety of things including, but not limited to, higher privileges (such as performing certain actions), private web content, sessions, and cookies.</description>
