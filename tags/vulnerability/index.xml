      <description>The recently disclosed remote code execution vulnerability in Apache Log4j2, a Java-based logging component, has caused significant impact worldwide. This component is used extensively in business system development to record logging information about program input and output, and is extremely widely used. In most cases, developers write error messages caused by user input to the log.
The sudden disclosure of this vulnerability has not only caused developers using Log4j2 to &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; the problem overnight, but also caught the framework maintainers off guard.</description>

      <description>As you may have seen in the news, a new zero-day exploit has been reported against the popular Log4J2 library which can allow an attacker to remotely execute code. The vulnerability has been reported with CVE-2021-44228 against the log4j-core jar and has been fixed in Log4J v2.15.0.
Spring Boot users are only affected by this vulnerability if they have switched the default logging system to Log4J2. The log4j-to-slf4j and log4j-api jars that we include in spring-boot-starter-logging cannot be exploited on their own.</description>
