      <description>Microservices to do user authentication and authorization has always been a difficult point, with the OAuth2.0 password mode was invalidated, it is even more difficult.This article will share some ideas.
Two ways of thinking There are usually two ways of thinking about authentication and authorization for microservices.
 All authentication authorization is handled by an independent user authentication authorization server, which is only responsible for issuing Token, and then the gateway is only responsible for forwarding requests to each microservice module, and each module of the microservice performs the verification process of Token by itself.</description>

      <description>This article looks at the configuration of OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server related filters. In turn, it provides a better understanding of the entire architecture of Spring Authorization Server. Modular configuration of Spring Security Currently OAuth2.0 Client, Resource Server, Authorization Server these are already modularized in the Spring Security system. So how do they achieve flexible modularity? After analyzing the configuration I found a few similarities below. These are the core</description>

      <description>Last November 8 Spring officials have strongly recommended to use Spring Authorization Server to replace the outdated Spring Security OAuth2.0. With not much time left before Spring Security OAuth2.0 ends its lifecycle, it&amp;rsquo;s time to make a change. Now that Spring Authorization Server is in production readiness, it&amp;rsquo;s time to learn it.
The current Spring Security architecture Spring Security 5.x modularizes OAuth2.0 Client and OAuth2.0 Resource Server. Spring Security is a mandatory dependency.</description>

      <title>Take RemoteTokenServices as an example - analyze the entire process of obtaining OAuth2 access tokens from the authorization server and loading authentication objects into the SecurityContext from the source code</title>

      <description>When we configure OAuth2, we will configure the resource server and authentication server. When our authorization service and authentication service are not in the same service, we can consider using RemoteTokenServices. If they are in the same service, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to configure tokenServices, because when ResourceServerConfigurerAdapter is configured, if tokenServices is not configured, a default DefaultTokenServices will be automatically configured. . The two tokenService classes both implement the ResourceServerTokenServices</description>
