      <description>What is the Hystrix Isolation Policy? Official documentation: https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/Configuration#executionisolationstrategy
Executing an isolation policy This property instructs HystrixCommand.run() which isolation policy to execute, being one of the following two options.
 THREAD - it is executed on a separate thread, and concurrent requests are limited by the number of threads in the thread pool SEMAPHORE - it is executed on the calling thread, and concurrent requests are limited by the amount of semaphore  Problem When the isolation policy is THREAD, there is no way to get the value in ThreadLocal.</description>

      <description>Talking about Spring Cloud ecosystem, you must be familiar with Feign, as shown below, Feign can hide the underlying (okhttp, httpclient) Rest requests, disguised as a SpringMVC-like Controller. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to splice the url, splice the parameters and so on by yourself, everything is left to Feign. Using Feign to call the API is like calling a local method, avoiding the tedium of constantly parsing/wrapping json data when calling the target microservice.</description>
