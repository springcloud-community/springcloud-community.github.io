      <title>SpringBoot With Gson</title>

      <description>Spring Boot uses Jackson by default as the serialization/deserialization framework for Json. But for me, I prefer Google&amp;rsquo;s Gson, which is much more concise. This article will teach you how to use Gson instead of Jackson in your Spring Boot application.
maven Spring Boot itself provides support for Gson, so you can import the Gson module directly without declaring a version number. If you are not using Jackson elsewhere, then you can exclude it from your project.</description>

      <title>How to set SameSite property for Cookie in SpringBoot application?</title>
      <link>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-04/spring-samesite/</link>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-04/spring-samesite/</guid>
      <description>Starting with Chrome 51, a new SameSite attribute has been added to the browser cookie to prevent CSRF attacks and user tracking.
1. What is a CSRF attack? Cookies are often used to store a user&amp;rsquo;s identity information, and a malicious website can manage to forge an HTTP request with the correct cookie, which is a CSRF attack.
For example, a user logs into the bank&amp;rsquo;s website your-bank.com and a cookie is sent from the bank&amp;rsquo;s server.</description>

      <title>CORS detailed explanation and how to configure in spring application</title>
      <link>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-04/spring-cors/</link>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-04/spring-cors/</guid>
      <description>CORS explained in detail CORS is a W3C standard, the full name is Cross-origin resource sharing.
It allows the browser to cross-origin server, issued XMLHttpRequest/fetch request, thus overcoming the AJAX can only be used in the same source of the limitations.
1. Introduction CORS requires both browser and server support. Currently, all browsers support this feature, and Internet Explorer cannot be lower than IE10.
The entire CORS communication process is done automatically by the browser, without user involvement.</description>

      <title>Build a Spring Boot REST API with Full-Text Search using Hibernate Search</title>
      <link>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-04/spring-boot-hibernate-search/</link>

      <description>Search is one of the pillars of the web, and full-text search is one of the mandatory features that every website needs. But implementing such a feature is complex, and lots of skilled engineers have already thought hard about this topic. So let&amp;rsquo;s not reinvent the wheel, and use the battle-tested Hibernate Search library.
In this blog post, we are going to learn how to build a simple REST API endpoint in Spring boot with full-text search using Hibernate Search.</description>

      <title>Build a Spring Boot REST API with Pagination and Sorting</title>
      <link>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-04/spring-boot-rest/</link>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-04/spring-boot-rest/</guid>
      <description>Pagination is an important feature for REST API, and is used for many use cases where we want to fetch only a small part of an entire dataset. It might be for performance reasons, and fetch only the data needed at that time. It can also be used by the frontend to display items using a paginated view type of UI such as infinite scrolling.
Spring Boot provides a pagination feature integrated into the spring data JPA library, making it easy to integrate such a mechanism in our own REST API.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this blog post we are going to look at how we can implement pagination with hateoas while supporting filtering and sorting in a spring boot application. We will first start off implementing filtering, and then iteratively page, sorting and finally pagination wtih Hateoas.

      <description>Introducing scripting capabilities into our application can be a good way to improve flexibility. Our core development work can be focused on the development of core platform capabilities, and scenario-specific functionality can be implemented through scripting. For example, jenkins can write pipelines through groovy scripts, which can be very flexible to customize the build process. spring itself provides a mechanism for groovy integration, divided into two ways, one is to use groovy development program, similar to the development with java, need to be compiled.</description>

      <title>Add Prefix to All Spring Boot Controllers</title>
      <link>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-03/spring-boot-controllers-add-prefix/</link>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-03/spring-boot-controllers-add-prefix/</guid>
      <description>1. Introduction In Spring Boot applications, every controller can have its own URL mapping. This makes it easy for a single application to provide web endpoints at multiple locations. For example, we can group our API endpoints into logic groupings such as internal and external.
However, there may be times where we want all of our endpoints under a common prefix. In this tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at different ways to use a common prefix for all Spring Boot controllers.</description>

      <description>In a distributed, fast-paced environment, dev teams often want to find out at what time they deployed the app, what version of the app they deployed, what Git commit was deployed, and more.
Spring Boot Actuator helps us monitor and manage the application. It exposes various endpoints that provide app health, metrics, and other relevant information.
In this article, we will find out how to use Spring Boot Actuator and the Maven/Gradle build plugins to add such information to our projects.</description>

      <description>1. Overview When using Spring Data MongoDB, we may need to log to a higher level than the default one. Typically, we may need to see, for example, some additional information such as statement executions or query parameters.
In this short tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how to modify the MongoDB logging level for queries.
2. Configure MongoDB Queries Logging MongoDB Support offers the MongoOperations interface or its primary MongoTemplate implementation to access data, so all we need is to configure a debug level for the MongoTemplate class.</description>

      <description>Previously, we used Docker to build services related to the development environment, and also to build dependency services in the development and testing environment, and then also used Nexus to build Docker&amp;rsquo;s self-service, so this time we came together to deploy SpringBoot applications with Docker. Step by step to all the Dockerization march.

      <description>Introduction Suppose our application organizes asynchronous domain logic inside DomainEventListener&amp;rsquo;s like the following code snippet.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  interface DomainEventListener { val topic: String fun handle(event: DomainEvent) } @Component class UserRegistered: DomainEventListener { override val topic = &amp;#34;user:registered&amp;#34; // How deserialization is performed is left out.  override fun handle(event: DomainEvent) { // perform business logic  } }   This post shows how to integrate these listeners with Spring AMQP by taking advantage of Spring&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure.</description>

      <description>In this tutorial, we will learn how to perform Integration testing Spring boot application using @SpringBootTest annotation.
We use MySQL database to store and retrieve the data.
Let&amp;rsquo;s first take a look at the overview of @SpringBootTest annotation.
@SpringBootTest Annotation Spring Boot provides @SpringBootTest annotation for Integration testing. This annotation creates an application context and loads the full application context.
@SpringBootTest will bootstrap the full application context, which means we can @Autowire any bean that&amp;rsquo;s picked up by component scanning into our test.</description>

      <description>The client encodes or encrypts the request body (e.g. AES encryption, Base64 encoding), and the server decodes the request body after receiving it. This is a very common requirement. Thanks to the RequestBodyAdvice interface provided by spring mvc. We can do this very easily and without modifying any code in the Controller. Practice The client&amp;rsquo;s request body is encoded using Base64 and the server automatically decodes it via RequestBodyAdvice. This</description>
