      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-05/springboot-hateoas/</guid>
      <description>HATEOAS is a principle to achieve the REST specification, by following the HATEOAS specification, we can solve the actual code to achieve a variety of individual problems. As the most popular framework for java Spring will of course not be absent from the integration of HATEOAS.
This article will explain how to use HATEOAS in SpringBoot through a specific example.
Our goal The HATEOAS rule returns data with links. Let&amp;rsquo;s take the familiar Book example to demonstrate this HATEOAS by first creating a Book entity.</description>

      <title>SpringBoot With Gson</title>
      <link>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-05/springboot-gson/</link>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-05/springboot-gson/</guid>
      <description>Spring Boot uses Jackson by default as the serialization/deserialization framework for Json. But for me, I prefer Google&amp;rsquo;s Gson, which is much more concise. This article will teach you how to use Gson instead of Jackson in your Spring Boot application.
maven Spring Boot itself provides support for Gson, so you can import the Gson module directly without declaring a version number. If you are not using Jackson elsewhere, then you can exclude it from your project.</description>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-04/spring-samesite/</guid>
      <description>Starting with Chrome 51, a new SameSite attribute has been added to the browser cookie to prevent CSRF attacks and user tracking.
1. What is a CSRF attack? Cookies are often used to store a user&amp;rsquo;s identity information, and a malicious website can manage to forge an HTTP request with the correct cookie, which is a CSRF attack.
For example, a user logs into the bank&amp;rsquo;s website your-bank.com and a cookie is sent from the bank&amp;rsquo;s server.</description>

      <description>CORS explained in detail CORS is a W3C standard, the full name is Cross-origin resource sharing.
It allows the browser to cross-origin server, issued XMLHttpRequest/fetch request, thus overcoming the AJAX can only be used in the same source of the limitations.
1. Introduction CORS requires both browser and server support. Currently, all browsers support this feature, and Internet Explorer cannot be lower than IE10.
The entire CORS communication process is done automatically by the browser, without user involvement.</description>

      <title>Build a Spring Boot REST API with Pagination and Sorting</title>
      <link>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-04/spring-boot-rest/</link>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-04/spring-boot-rest/</guid>
      <description>Pagination is an important feature for REST API, and is used for many use cases where we want to fetch only a small part of an entire dataset. It might be for performance reasons, and fetch only the data needed at that time. It can also be used by the frontend to display items using a paginated view type of UI such as infinite scrolling.
Spring Boot provides a pagination feature integrated into the spring data JPA library, making it easy to integrate such a mechanism in our own REST API.</description>

      <description>Introducing scripting capabilities into our application can be a good way to improve flexibility. Our core development work can be focused on the development of core platform capabilities, and scenario-specific functionality can be implemented through scripting. For example, jenkins can write pipelines through groovy scripts, which can be very flexible to customize the build process. spring itself provides a mechanism for groovy integration, divided into two ways, one is to use groovy development program, similar to the development with java, need to be compiled.</description>

      <title>Add Prefix to All Spring Boot Controllers</title>
      <link>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-03/spring-boot-controllers-add-prefix/</link>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-03/spring-boot-controllers-add-prefix/</guid>
      <description>1. Introduction In Spring Boot applications, every controller can have its own URL mapping. This makes it easy for a single application to provide web endpoints at multiple locations. For example, we can group our API endpoints into logic groupings such as internal and external.
However, there may be times where we want all of our endpoints under a common prefix. In this tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at different ways to use a common prefix for all Spring Boot controllers.</description>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-03/spring-boot-integration-testing-mysql-crud-rest-api-tutorial/</guid>
      <description>In this tutorial, we will learn how to perform Integration testing Spring boot application using @SpringBootTest annotation.
We use MySQL database to store and retrieve the data.
Let&amp;rsquo;s first take a look at the overview of @SpringBootTest annotation.
@SpringBootTest Annotation Spring Boot provides @SpringBootTest annotation for Integration testing. This annotation creates an application context and loads the full application context.
@SpringBootTest will bootstrap the full application context, which means we can @Autowire any bean that&amp;rsquo;s picked up by component scanning into our test.</description>
