      <description>It finally happened! They did it! They did it just in time for me to get on the road and start building applications on the road with my shiny new laptop, too! JOY!! Oracle and the GraalVM team released GraalVM and the GraalVM native image capability for Apple M1! I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for this day for so, so, so long! I bought the first Apple M1 the day of the announcement way back in 2020 (does anybody remember that far back?</description>

      <description>On behalf of the team and everyone who has contributed, it is my pleasure to announce the release of Spring Native 0.11, which provides native support for Spring Boot 2.6. This ambitious release is the result of five months of hard work by the Spring team, who have been working on a brand new architecture to bring Spring support for creating native executables with GraalVM to the next level. You can already try it on start.</description>
