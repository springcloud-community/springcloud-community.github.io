      <description>Introduction Suppose our application organizes asynchronous domain logic inside DomainEventListener&amp;rsquo;s like the following code snippet.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  interface DomainEventListener { val topic: String fun handle(event: DomainEvent) } @Component class UserRegistered: DomainEventListener { override val topic = &amp;#34;user:registered&amp;#34; // How deserialization is performed is left out.  override fun handle(event: DomainEvent) { // perform business logic  } }   This post shows how to integrate these listeners with Spring AMQP by taking advantage of Spring&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Moving from Spring Cloud Netflix Zuul to Spring Cloud Gateway</title>
      <link>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-03/netflix-zuul-to-spring-cloud-gateway/</link>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-03/netflix-zuul-to-spring-cloud-gateway/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Netflix Zuul for many years as a proxy for APIs. Some weeks ago I tried to bootstrap a new project and add the zuul starter via spring initializr and couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it anymore. After some research it seems that Spring Cloud has moved over to Cloud Gateway and discontinued Netflix Zuul. Maybe this was just a rebranding of the Spring team but tbh I don&amp;rsquo;t care and want to follow the Spring Cloud team with that.</description>

      <title>Spring Security without the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter</title>
      <link>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-03/spring-security-without-the-websecurityconfigureradapter/</link>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-03/spring-security-without-the-websecurityconfigureradapter/</guid>
      <description>In Spring Security 5.7.0-M2 we deprecated the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter , as we encourage users to move towards a component-based security configuration.
To assist with the transition to this new style of configuration, we have compiled a list of common use-cases and the suggested alternatives going forward.
In the examples below we follow best practice by using the Spring Security lambda DSL and the method HttpSecurity#authorizeHttpRequests to define our authorization rules. If you are new to the lambda DSL you can read about it in this blog post.</description>

      <description>Micro-services are all good until they come with their distributed challenges which normally we don&amp;rsquo;t face in monolithic based applications. Just like this one!
Understanding the problem In order to fully get the main purpose of the solution let us first understand the underlying problem.
As the diagram above shows, we have to micro-services communicating via a certain network:
 Micro-service I with the IP address 10.10.10.10 , and port 8080 Micro-service II with the IP address 20.</description>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-03/messaging-using-rabbitmq-in-spring-boot-application/</guid>
      <description>In this article, we will learn about RabbitMQ and explore its common use-cases. We will also walk through a step-by-step guide to implement messaging using RabbitMQ in a Spring Boot Application and will see how to publish and consume messages in a queue using RabbitMQ. So, let&amp;rsquo;s begin learning!
What is a RabbitMQ? RabbitMQ is an open-source message broker that allows enterprise applications to communicate with each other. It&amp;rsquo;s a popular AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol)broker.</description>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-03/load-balanced-websockets-with-spring-cloud-gateway/</guid>
      <description>The ability to have real-time two-way communication between the client and the server is a key feature in most modern web apps.
A simple approach to setting up WebSockets in Spring Boot is covered in Simple WebSockets with Spring Boot, which uses an in-memory message broker. This approach falls short, though, when you scale up and add additional servers. Users connected to different servers would have no way of communicating or getting updates pushed to them for something that&amp;rsquo;s happened on another server.</description>

      <title>Spring Cloud Config Server - Encryption and Decryption</title>
      <link>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-03/spring-cloud-config-server-encryption-and-decryption/</link>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-03/spring-cloud-config-server-encryption-and-decryption/</guid>
      <description>While using Spring Cloud Config Server, we also have the feature to encrypt sensitive information that is otherwise stored as plain text in our external git repository. This prevents anyone who has read access to the external repository from accessing confidential information and is highly highly recommended if you are using a Spring Cloud Config Server.
 Note: If you haven&amp;rsquo;t set up Spring Cloud Config Server yet check out my other article on how to set up a spring cloud config server.</description>

      <description>Spring Cloud Config Server is used to provide server-side and client-side support for externalized configuration in a distributed system. So when you have multiple microservices, and you want to easily control the configuration for all of them at one go - you&amp;rsquo;ll mostly be looking at Spring Cloud Config Server.
So how do we do this? We will create a git project which contains all your properties files for the multiple microservices that you have (easy enough).</description>

      <description>In this tutorial, we will learn how to perform Integration testing Spring boot application using @SpringBootTest annotation.
We use MySQL database to store and retrieve the data.
Let&amp;rsquo;s first take a look at the overview of @SpringBootTest annotation.
@SpringBootTest Annotation Spring Boot provides @SpringBootTest annotation for Integration testing. This annotation creates an application context and loads the full application context.
@SpringBootTest will bootstrap the full application context, which means we can @Autowire any bean that&amp;rsquo;s picked up by component scanning into our test.</description>

      <description>1. Introduction A common use case for the Spring Cloud Gateway is to act as a facade to one or more services, thus offering clients a simpler way to consume them.
In this tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;ll show different ways to customize the exposed APIs by rewriting the URLs before sending the request to the backends.
2. Spring Cloud Gateway Quick Recap The Spring Cloud Gateway project is built on top of the popular Spring Boot 2 and Project Reactor, so it inherits its main treats:</description>

      <description>The client encodes or encrypts the request body (e.g. AES encryption, Base64 encoding), and the server decodes the request body after receiving it. This is a very common requirement. Thanks to the RequestBodyAdvice interface provided by spring mvc. We can do this very easily and without modifying any code in the Controller. Practice The client&amp;rsquo;s request body is encoded using Base64 and the server automatically decodes it via RequestBodyAdvice. This</description>

      <title>How to Record Request and Response Bodies in Sping Boot Applications</title>
      <link>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-03/record-request-and-response-bodies/</link>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-03/record-request-and-response-bodies/</guid>
      <description>In some scenarios, we need to log every client request and response log (including detailed body information).
As you know, streams can only be read once. If we read the request body first in order to log it, then spring&amp;rsquo;s HttpMessageConverter will throw an exception when it reads the request body again: org.springframework.http.converter. HttpMessageNotReadableException: Required request body is missing: ....
The following example demonstrates this situation.

      <title>Improve file download efficiency with Zero Copy</title>
      <link>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-03/zero-copy/</link>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-03/zero-copy/</guid>
      <description>Zero-Copy The &amp;ldquo;zero&amp;rdquo; of zero-copy means that the number of times data is copied between user and kernel states is zero.
Traditional data copying (file-to-file, client-to-server, etc.) involves four user-state to kernel-state switches and four copies. two of the four copies between user-state and kernel-state require CPU participation, while two copies between kernel-state and IO devices do not require CPU participation in DMA mode. Zero-copy avoids copying between user and kernel states (2 times) and reduces the switching between user and kernel states twice, so the data transfer efficiency is high.</description>
