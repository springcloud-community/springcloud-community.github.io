      <description>1. Background spring cloud is the de facto standard for microservices in the java application world, it provides very rich and complete microservice components and is very easy to integrate with java applications. However, as many features of spring cloud are integrated into applications through java jar packages in the form of SDK calls (e.g. eureka client, spring cloud config client, etc.), applications developed in other languages (e.g. go, python,</description>

      <description>Microservice is a software architecture that is gaining more and more attention.
But what does it really mean? What kind of architecture can be called microservices?
There are many articles on the Internet, but they are too complicated for beginners to understand. In my opinion, the concept is actually very simple and can be understood in layman&amp;rsquo;s terms.
1. Monolithic Software To understand microservices, you first need to understand the evolution of software architecture.</description>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-04/spring-samesite/</guid>
      <description>Starting with Chrome 51, a new SameSite attribute has been added to the browser cookie to prevent CSRF attacks and user tracking.
1. What is a CSRF attack? Cookies are often used to store a user&amp;rsquo;s identity information, and a malicious website can manage to forge an HTTP request with the correct cookie, which is a CSRF attack.
For example, a user logs into the bank&amp;rsquo;s website your-bank.com and a cookie is sent from the bank&amp;rsquo;s server.</description>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-04/jsoup-xss/</guid>
      <description>XSS An XSS attack is usually a clever way of injecting malicious command code into a web page by exploiting a vulnerability left in the web page&amp;rsquo;s development, causing the user to load and execute a malicious web program created by the attacker. These malicious web programs are usually JavaScript, but can actually include Java, VBScript, ActiveX, Flash, or even plain HTML, and when the attack is successful, the attacker may gain access to a variety of things including, but not limited to, higher privileges (such as performing certain actions), private web content, sessions, and cookies.</description>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-04/spring-cloud-gatewat-oauth2/</guid>
      <description>Microservices to do user authentication and authorization has always been a difficult point, with the OAuth2.0 password mode was invalidated, it is even more difficult.This article will share some ideas.
Two ways of thinking There are usually two ways of thinking about authentication and authorization for microservices.
 All authentication authorization is handled by an independent user authentication authorization server, which is only responsible for issuing Token, and then the gateway is only responsible for forwarding requests to each microservice module, and each module of the microservice performs the verification process of Token by itself.</description>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-04/jpa-bootstrap-mode/</guid>
      <description>1. Introduction In this brief tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;ll focus on the different types of BootstrapMode for JPA repositories that Spring provides for altering the orchestration of their instantiation.
At startup, Spring Data scans for repositories and registers their bean definitions as singleton-scoped beans. During their initialization, repositories obtain an EntityManager immediately. Specifically, they get the JPA metamodel and validate declared queries.
JPA is bootstrapped synchronously by default. Consequently, the instantiation of repositories is blocked until the bootstrap process completes .</description>

      <title>Build a Spring Boot REST API with Pagination and Sorting</title>
      <link>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-04/spring-boot-rest/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Apr 2022 14:34:59 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-04/spring-boot-rest/</guid>
      <description>Pagination is an important feature for REST API, and is used for many use cases where we want to fetch only a small part of an entire dataset. It might be for performance reasons, and fetch only the data needed at that time. It can also be used by the frontend to display items using a paginated view type of UI such as infinite scrolling.
Spring Boot provides a pagination feature integrated into the spring data JPA library, making it easy to integrate such a mechanism in our own REST API.</description>

      <title>Unified configuration management using Spring Cloud Config</title>
      <link>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-04/spring-cloud-config-usage/</link>

      <description>1 Preface Configurability is a feature that a mature software system should provide, and configuration management is important for large systems, especially for microservices systems with multiple applications. Happily, Spring provides us with good configuration management, such as the powerful configuration of Springboot. For Spring Cloud, there is the powerful Spring Cloud Config which is very useful for distributed system configuration management by providing a configuration management outside the application,</description>

      <title>Getting Started with Data Flow Shell</title>
      <link>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-04/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell/</link>

      <guid>https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-04/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell/</guid>
      <description>1 Preface In the previous article about Spring Cloud Data Flow, the examples were operated through the UI. The Linux server environment generally uses the command line. The integration on Jenkins does not work with the UI either. The good thing is that the official Data Flow Shell tool is available and can be operated in command line mode, which is very convenient.
The Spring Cloud Data Flow Server provides an operational REST API, so the essence of this Shell tool is still to interact by calling the REST API.</description>
